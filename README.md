# mooctest-data-accessment-frontend

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development and serves locally

npm run serve_local_dev
```

###Compiles and minifies for production and serves locally

npm run serve_local_pro
```

### Compiles and minifies for production for github page

```
npm run serve_local_pro
```

Note that we don't have to use this command. The code in [.github/workflow](.github/workflow) will automatically call this command. For gitlab without git-action the workflow doesn't work.
